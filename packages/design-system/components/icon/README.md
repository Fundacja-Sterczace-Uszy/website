# Use icons

1. Use Icon.jsx component
2. You can choose an icon by passing the name prop to Icon.jsx component where you have all available icons' name in icons const.
3. You can pass to icon props:
   - name: (string)
   - color: (string)
   - size: ["small", "medium", "large", "xlarge", "xxlarge"]
     - small (16 x16), medium (24 x 24), large(30 x 30)- have square proportions that fit most of the icons we use
     - xlarge (23 x 36) and xxlarge (30 x 48)- have different proportions and are intended for icons: dog, one, two, three

# Icon

You can choose an icon by passing the name prop to Icon.jsx component where you have all available icons' name in icons const.
You can pass to icon props:

- name: (string)
- color: (string)
- size: ["small", "medium", "large", "xlarge", "xxlarge"]
  - small (16 x16), medium (24 x 24), large(30 x 30) - have square proportions that fit most of the icons we use
  - xlarge (23 x 36) and xxlarge (30 x 48)- have different proportions and are intended for icon: dog
